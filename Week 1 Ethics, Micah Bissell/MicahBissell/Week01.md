# Week 1 Ethics Assignment

Prompt: While working as an engineer at a Credit Card company, you are tasked to resolve problems experienced by your employerâ€™s second largest customer: a well-known pornography web site. Resolving their problems will not only reduce their frustration but should make them considerably more efficient and profitable. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

### Possible Responses

<b>Response 1: Accept the Job</b>

Pros- Completes work benefiting company/boss/coworkers, honors contractual obligations, helps relieve frustrations (unethical though they may be)

Cons- Supports a sinful and unethical industry financially, could be conducive to leading others into sin, continues what has evidently been a strong relationship between the company and the industry

Dialog- 

Boss: "Will you take care of this problem and help get ____ back on track? That's the pornography website, our second biggest client."

Employee: "You've got it, I'll get to work ASAP."

Biblical Reference- "Commit your work to the Lord, and your plans will be established." -Proverbs 16:3, ESV

First Principle- I believe that it is possible to honor God in any circumstance. In this scenario, choosing to accept the work can be honorable as a form of dedication to the work given to you. Fulfilling the obligations that were given to you by authority is a form of worship and dedication in itself. A Christian in this situation could choose to accept the job, trust that God understands the motive behind the decision, and work future developments for His good.

<b>Response 2: Decline the Job</b>

Pros- Keeps your conscience clear, does not support the industry in any way shape or form, sets a clear personal boundary on what projects you are comfortable working on

Cons- Could result in being fired, does not fulfill contractual obligations, inevitably passes the job off to someone else who may have the same conflict

Dialog-

Boss: "Will you take care of this problem and help get ____ back on track? That's the pornography website, our second biggest client."

Employee: "I'm sorry, I'm not really comfortable working to support them. I can't accept this job in good conscience."

Boss: "I appreciate the transparency but we're going to have to find a way to make this work or I'll have to let you go."

Biblical Reference- "It is good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that causes your brother to stumble." -Romans 14:21

First Principle- One way for a Christian to look at this situation is to understand that helping the website is inevitably going to indirectly lead others into sin, and that can be a hard line that is worth staying behind. For some, sticking to the principle found in Romans 14:21 is worth everything, including potentially losing employment, as is possible in this scenario.
