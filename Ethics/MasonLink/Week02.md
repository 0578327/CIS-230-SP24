Prompt: While working as an engineer at a Consultancy, you are assigned to project using Machine Learning to improve customer efficiency. When successful, the customer plans to lay off more than 175 employees. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

<h2>Response 1</h2>

<h4>Pros</h4>

- You are not responsible for the employees.
- The employees may deserve to be laid off.

<h4>Cons</h4>

- You will be initiating 175 people losing their jobs.
- You may incur anger from the laid off employees.

<h4>Dialog</h4>

<p> One response to this situation would be to continue to finish the project, despite the fact that the 175 employees will be laid off. One could argue that you are not responsible for those employees, and that you are simply doing you job. Also, you do not know the reason why these employees are being laid off, as many of them could potentially be lazy or underworking employees. For example, in late 2022, Twitter laid off over 2000 employees who were apparently not doing anything productive day to day. However, in agreeing to undertake the project, you are knowingly allowing many employees to lose their jobs. In addition to this, you may incur some anger or resentment from said laid off employees.</p>
