- **Pastor:** That's wonderful, Jaxson. What are your thoughts?
- **Jaxson:** I believe that leading by example is crucial for effective ministry. However, I also understand that everyone has their own challenges.
- **Pastor:** I appreciate your understanding, Jaxson. Let's continue to support each other in our spiritual journey.
### First Principle: Humility

## Personal Choice: I would probably go with the second response, simply because I don't think I would want to confront the senior pastor so directly. Alaso, were I to go to other leaders in the church, they might be more inclined to approach him.
